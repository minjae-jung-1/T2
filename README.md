Web App to help create private games instead of joining public lobbies.
The app was inspired by the free time that the covid virus has left us in.
This will allow large groups of friends to connect on their favorite games but have the privacy and comfort to themselves.
Currently the app is building a process for which 10 people would queue up to find a game and the webapp would split them into teams. The next step would be to start a server for the game. We are currently working with a few apis (IE: RIOT) to start this process.
