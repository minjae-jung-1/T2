Web App to help create private games instead of joining public lobbies.
The app was inspired by the free time that the covid virus has left us in.
This will allow large groups of friends to connect on their favorite games but have the privacy and comfort to themselves.
Currently the app is building a process for which 10 people would queue up to find a game and the webapp would split them into teams. The next step would be to start a server for the game. We are currently working with a few apis (IE: RIOT) to start this process. 
We also currently have a working log in page with a mongo database to host all of our users. Another implementation we added as a chat system so that the users can interact with one another. The next step is creating a system that collects game data ( ranks win/loss ratios and ratings) to assist in creating and splitting teams.
